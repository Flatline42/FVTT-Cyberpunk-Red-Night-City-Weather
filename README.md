<h1><strong>Night City Weather Generator</strong></h1>
<p>This is a collection of scripts, tables, and journal placeholders from R Talsorian Games' Cyberpunk Red DLC Night City Weather found here:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rtalsoriangames.com/downloadable-content/">https://rtalsoriangames.com/downloadable-content/</a></p>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>FVTT Cyberpunk Red system</li>
    <li>Simple Calendar- A standard Gregorian calendar probably is best but at minimum the calendar needs Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter seasons designated.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>Once activated, drag the current weather icon in the scripts compendium to your toolbar to run. No compendiums need to be imported.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Limitations:</h2>
<p>This compendium module also rolls references to journals that are empty placeholders. Descriptions may be added after you unlock the journals compendium and edit the pages as you wish. Due to RTG's homebrew policy I will not be adding the text details into the module. You're free to unlock the journal compendium and edit the journals however.</p>
